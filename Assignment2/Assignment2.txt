Errors are coming as below two rules are violated in the code1 :
1.	THEN Instructions should have condition as a suffix. (Eg. In code1, MOV R3, #0x100 should be MOVLT R3, #0x100).
2.	The ELSE condition must be the inverse of the THEN condition. i.e. As GE is inverse of LT, last instruction should involve GE in the instruction.
